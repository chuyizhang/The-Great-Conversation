# BEFORE PHILOSOPHY

Every culture offers answers to philosophical questions, though not every culture has developed what we know as philosophy. Early answers to philosophical questions universally take the form of stories, usually stories involving the gods. We call these stories **myths**.

Myths are told and retold, taught to children as the plain facts, gaining authority by their age, by repetition, and by the apparent fact that within a given culture, virtually everyone accepts them. They shape a tradition, and traditions shape lives.

Philosophy begins when people try to give good reasons for believing or not believing these myths. Philosophers look at myths with a critical eye, sometimes defending them and sometimes appreciating what myths try to do, but often attacking myths’ claims to literal truth.

## Hesiod: War Among the Gods

The poet we know as Hesiod composed the poem *Theogony*. The term ”theogony” means “origin or birth of the gods.” The stories contained in the poem concern the beginnings of all things.

Hesiod claims to have written Theogony under *divine inspiration*, and that the stories he narrates are backed by the authority of the gods and embody the remembrance of events long past. The stories thus represent the truth and are worthy of belief.

### The Story of *Theogony*

    First there is chaos. Out of this chaos, Earth appears. Earth then gives birth to Heaven. The origin of gods is explicitly sexual: After lying with Heaven, Earth bears the first race of gods, the Titans.

    In addition to the twelve Titans, Earth and Heaven have another six children: three giants with only one eye (the Cyclops), and three other giants each with a hundred arms and fifty heads. These six awful sons are hated by Heaven from the first and are hid by Heaven in Tartarus. Heaven enjoys his wickedness.

    Earth, distressed and pained, forms a great sickle and urges her children to use it on their father for his shameful deeds. The boldest of the Titans, Kronos, takes the sickle and harvests his father’s genitals.

    Kronos, now ruler among the Titans, has three children by Rhea: Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Learning of a prophecy that he will be dethroned by one of these children, Kronos seizes the newborns and swallows them. When Rhea bears another son, she hides him away in a cave. The hidden son is Zeus.

    When Zeus grown to full strength, he saved his brothers and sisters by persuading Kronos to drink a potion that causes vomiting. Together with his brothers and their allies, Zeus makes war on the Titans. The war drags on for ten years until Zeus overthrow Kronos and the Titans and hurl them down into Tartarus.

    Zeus and his brothers divide up the territory: Zeus rules the sky; Poseidon governs the sea; and Hades reigns in Tartarus. Earth is shared by all three. Thus, the gods set up a relatively stable order in the universe, an order both natural and moral.

The moral run through the story: Wickedness is punished and virtue is rewarded; violating the rule of justice—even in the service of justice—brings consequences.

## Homer: Heroes, Gods, and Excellence

For centuries, Greeks listened to or read the works of Homer. His dramatic stories offered a picture of the world and people’s place in it that molded the Greek mind and character. Western philosophy begins against the Homeric background.

Homer simply takes for granted the tradition of gods and heroes set down in Hesiod’s *Theogony*.

Homer's two great poems are *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*.

### The Story of *The Iliad*

    The Iliad is a long poem about the nine-year-long Trojan war. The war came about when Paris, son of the Trojan king Priam, seduced Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaus. Paris spirited Helen away to his home in Troy. Menelaus’s brother, Agamemnon, led an army of Greeks to recover Helen. Among Agamemnon’s forces was Achilles, the greatest warrior.

    In a raid on a Trojan ally, the Greeks capture the daughter of a priest of Apollo and awards her to Agamemnon as part of his spoils. The priest comes to plead for the return of her daughter but he is rebuffed. The priest appeals to Apollo and Apollo sends a plague to Agamemnon’s troops.

    Agamemnon finally agrees to give up the girl but demands Achilles’ prize, an exceptionally
    lovely woman, in exchange. The two heroes quarrel bitterly and Achilles refuses to fight anymore.

    The war goes badly for the Greeks. So Patroclus, Achilles’ dearest friend, take Achilles’ armor and fight in his place. The Greeks drive the Trojans back toward the city, but Patroclus is killed by Hector, another son of Priam.

    Achilles rejoins the war and kills Hector. King Priam goes alone by night into the Greek
    camp to plead with Achilles for the body of his son. He and Achilles weep together, for Hector and for Patroclus, and Achilles gives up the body.

### Homeric Ethics

From the point of view of the human side, *The Iliad* can be thought of as the story both of the tragedy that excess and pride lead to, and of the humanization of Achilles. **Moderation** is what Achilles lacked, and his lack led to disaster.
> Rage—Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses...

The poem also celebrates the “heroic virtues”: strength, courage, physical prowess and wisdom. The heroic virtues together with moderation make up the model of *human excellence*.

### Homeric Gods

Homeric religion is not exactly a true polytheism. The many powers that govern the world seem to be under the rule of one. The rule gives a *just* order to the universe. The mortals and gods in Homer’s world covet **honor** and glory above all else. What is just in this social world is that each person receive the honor that is due, given that person’s status and position.

The chief difference between human beings and the gods is that human beings are bound for death and the gods are not. Greeks often refer to the gods simply as “the *immortals*.” As immortals, the gods are interested in the affairs of mortals, but only insofar as they are entertained or their honor is touched. They are spectators of the human comedy—or tragedy.

The gods both deserve and demand honor, punishing humans who refuse to give it. When humans dishonor the gods, they are guilty of **hubris**. In this state, human beings in effect think of themselves as gods. The gulf between Homeric gods and mortals is clear and impassable.

Those whose thoughts were shaped by Homer neither believed in nor aspired to any immortality worth prizing. Nothing after death could compare to glory in this life.
> Well let me die—but not without struggle, not without glory, no...
