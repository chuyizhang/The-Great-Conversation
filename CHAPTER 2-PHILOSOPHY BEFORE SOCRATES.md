# PHILOSOPHY BEFORE SOCRATES

## The Pre-Socratics

A little more than a century before Socrates’ birth, Western philosophy was born when Greek thinkers on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea began to challenge the traditional myths with attempts at more rational explanations of the world around them.

These thinkers are usually known as the “pre-Socratics,” about whom We have a scarcity of information. Although most of them wrote books, these writings are almost entirely lost, some surviving in small fragments, others known only by references to them and quotations or paraphrases by later writers.

## Questions to Answer

These earliest Greek philosophers were not content with stories about the gods, but the questions addressed by the myths were real questions:

- What is the true nature of reality? What is its origin?
- What is our place in it? How are we related to the powers that govern it?
- What is the best way to live?

Issues that took center stage in early Greek philosophical thought:

- *The one and the many*:

    If reality is in some sense one, what accounts for the many different individual things (and kinds of things) that we experience?
- *Reality and appearance*:

    Things are not always what they seem. Might reality in fact be very different from the way it appears in our experience? How could we know?
- *Human reality*:

    Who are we, and how are we related to the rest of what there is?
