# PHILOSOPHY BEFORE SOCRATES

## The Pre-Socratics

A little more than a century before Socrates’ birth, Western philosophy was born when Greek thinkers on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea began to challenge the traditional myths with attempts at more rational explanations of the world around them.

These thinkers are usually known as the “pre-Socratics,” about whom We have a scarcity of information. Although most of them wrote books, these writings are almost entirely lost, some surviving in small fragments, others known only by references to them and quotations or paraphrases by later writers.

## Questions to Answer

These earliest Greek philosophers were not content with stories about the gods, but the questions addressed by the myths were real questions:

- What is the true nature of reality? What is its origin?
- What is our place in it? How are we related to the powers that govern it?
- What is the best way to live?

Issues that took center stage in early Greek philosophical thought:

- *The one and the many*:

    If reality is in some sense one, what accounts for the many different individual things (and kinds of things) that we experience?
- *Reality and appearance*:

    Things are not always what they seem. Might reality in fact be very different from the way it appears in our experience? How could we know?
- *Human reality*:

    Who are we, and how are we related to the rest of what there is?

## Thales: The One as Water

Thales of Miletus was called *the founder of philosophy* by Aristotle. We know very little about Thales. He is said to have held:

1. The cause and element of all things is water.
2. All things are filled with gods.

It is striking that Thales supposes there is some *one* thing that is both the origin and the underlying nature of all things and he chooses one of the things that occur naturally in the world of our experience to play that role.
> Account for what you can see and touch in terms of things you can see and touch.

Why would Thales choose water to play the role of the primeval stuff?

- Water is essential for the nourishment of all things.
- Water is the only naturally occurring substance that can be seen to vary from solid to liquid to gas. It might take even more forms.

The saying that all things are full of gods is consistent with the saying about water. To say that all things are full of gods is to say in effect:

- In each thing—not outside it or in addition to it—is a principle that is immortal.
- Things of experience do not need explanations from outside themselves as to why they exist.
- Things have the principles of their behavior within themselves and we do not have to appeal beyond them (Zeus' will) to explain why events happen.

Both sayings of Thales suggest that if we want to understand this world, then we should look to *this* world, not to another. Thales seems to have been the first to have tried to answer the question, Why do things happen as they do? in terms that are not immediately personal. In framing his answer this way, Thales is not only the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, but also the first *scientist*.
