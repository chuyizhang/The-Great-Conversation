# PHILOSOPHY BEFORE SOCRATES

## The Pre-Socratics

A little more than a century before Socrates’ birth, Western philosophy was born when Greek thinkers on the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea began to challenge the traditional myths with attempts at more rational explanations of the world around them.

These thinkers are usually known as the “pre-Socratics,” about whom We have a scarcity of information. Although most of them wrote books, these writings are almost entirely lost, some surviving in small fragments, others known only by references to them and quotations or paraphrases by later writers.

## Questions to Answer

These earliest Greek philosophers were not content with stories about the gods, but the questions addressed by the myths were real questions:

- What is the true nature of reality? What is its origin?
- What is our place in it? How are we related to the powers that govern it?
- What is the best way to live?

Issues that took center stage in early Greek philosophical thought:

- *The one and the many*:

    If reality is in some sense one, what accounts for the many different individual things (and kinds of things) that we experience?
- *Reality and appearance*:

    Things are not always what they seem. Might reality in fact be very different from the way it appears in our experience? How could we know?
- *Human reality*:

    Who are we, and how are we related to the rest of what there is?

## Thales: The One as Water

Thales of Miletus was called *the founder of philosophy* by Aristotle. We know very little about Thales. He is said to have held:

1. The cause and element of all things is water.
2. All things are filled with gods.

It is striking that Thales supposes there is some *one* thing that is both the origin and the underlying nature of all things and he chooses one of the things that occur naturally in the world of our experience to play that role.
> Account for what you can see and touch in terms of things you can see and touch.

Why would Thales choose water to play the role of the primeval stuff?

- Water is essential for the nourishment of all things.
- Water is the only naturally occurring substance that can be seen to vary from solid to liquid to gas. It might take even more forms.

The saying that all things are full of gods is consistent with the saying about water. To say that all things are full of gods is to say in effect:

- In each thing—not outside it or in addition to it—is a principle that is immortal.
- Things of experience do not need explanations from outside themselves as to why they exist.
- Things have the principles of their behavior within themselves and we do not have to appeal beyond them (Zeus' will) to explain why events happen.

Both sayings of Thales suggest that if we want to understand this world, then we should look to *this* world, not to another. Thales seems to have been the first to have tried to answer the question, Why do things happen as they do? in terms that are not immediately personal. In framing his answer this way, Thales is not only the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, but also the first *scientist*.

## Anaximander: The One as the Boundless

There are three problems in Thales’ idea:

- We have no evidence that Thales addresses the question of how water accounts for everything else.
- Water itself is not unusual, and it is just one of the many things that need to be explained.
- Ancient Greeks tended to think in terms of opposites: wet and dry, hot and cold. If the origin of all things were water, how could the dry have ever come into existence?

### The Boundless

Like Thales, Anaximander wants an account of origins that does not appeal to the gods of Homer and Hesiod, but he does not reject the divine altogether.

Anaximander’s reasoning can be reconstructed like this:

1. Everything has a beginning.
2. The beginning must also have a beginning.
3. But this cannot go on forever.
4. So there must be something that itself has no beginning.
5. We can call this “the infinite” or “**the Boundless**.”

Only the Boundless can be a beginning for all other things. The Boundless is unlimited. It has no beginning and no end. It is *divine*. The Boundless “encompasses all things” and “steers all things.”

### One to Many

#### The Chaos

The Boundless is indefinite, so it cannot have a clear nature of its own. It must contain all things but in a “chaotic” mixture. The hot, the cold, the dry, and the wet are all present in the Boundless without clear differentiation.

#### The Four Elements

At this early stage of thought, no clear distinction is made between heat as a property of a thing and the thing that is hot. There is just “the hot” and “the cold”, which may be thought of as hot stuff and cold stuff.

|The Cold|The Wet|The Dry|The Hot|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Earth|Water|Air|Fire|

To the ancient Greeks, the universe seems to be composed of various mixtures of these elemental stuffs.

#### The Vortex Motion

Anaximander's explanation on how the basic four elements separate out from the chaos: If the Boundless were swirling in a **vortex motion**, then the four elements in it would become separated out according to their weights.

Experience we have as evidence for the vortex motion:

- Anaximander's water swirling experiment
- Heavenly bodies swirl around the earth.
- Fire leaps up, away from the cold earth toward the hot sun. (Like goes to like.)

Anaximander turns not to gods or myths to try to explain the nature of the world, but to reasoning and experience.

### The Principle of Balance

> Existing things ... make reparation to one another for their injustice according to the ordinance of time.

Much as Homer requires a certain moderation or balance in human behavior, Anaximander presupposes a principle of balance in nature. According to Anaximander, there is a balance between hot and cold, wet and dry in seasonal changes.

Unlike in Hesiod and Homer, Anaximander’s cosmic balance is not imposed on reality by the gods. Instead, he conceives it as immanent in the world process itself.

Anaximander’s explanations are framed impersonally. It is true that the Boundless “steers all things,” but the jealous and vengeful Homeric gods who intervene at will in the world have vanished. To explain particular facts in the world, no will, no purpose, no emotion, no intention is needed. The gods turn out to be superfluous.

## Xenophanes: The Gods as Fictions

Xenophanes seems to have been the first to state clearly the religious implications of the new nature philosophy. Unlike Anaximander, who only criticized the gods implicitly, Xenophanes explicitly criticizes the traditional conception of the gods.

> Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods all those things which in men are a matter for reproach and censure: stealing, adultery, and mutual deception.

Xenophanes clearly expresses his disapproval the way Hesiod and Homer picture the gods. He thinks it is shameful to portray the gods as though they are morally no better than human.

Xenophanes's criticism makes sense only on the basis of the assumption that Homer is not simply reporting the truth but is inventing stories.

> Horses would draw the gods in the shape of horses, and oxen in the shape of oxen, each giving the gods bodies similar to their own.

This is the first recorded version of the saying that god does not make man in his own image but that we make the gods in our image.

### The One God

Xenophanes is not a disbeliever in the divine.
> ... one god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or mind.

According to Xenophanes, there is only **one god**, and this god is radically different from anything in the Homeric tradition.

> He sees all over, thinks all over, hears all over.
>
> He remains always in the same place, without moving.
>
> He sets all things in motion by the thought of his mind.

|Humans|The One God|
|:---|:---|
|See and think and hear|See and think and hear, but in different way|
|Keep moving|Without moving|
|Move things by hand|Sets all things in motion by thought|
|Intelligent|Intelligent|

There is an assumption that seems to have been common among the Greeks: Where there is order, there is *intelligence*. Order, whether in our lives or in the world of nature, needs an explanation, and only intelligence can explain it.

### Nature Philosophy

> She whom men call “Iris,” too, is in reality a cloud, purple, red, and green to the sight.

In *The Iliad*, Iris is a minor goddess, a messenger for the other gods. She seems to have been identified with the rainbow, which many cultures have taken as a sign or message from the gods.

Xenophanes tells us that rainbows are simply natural phenomena that occur in natural circumstances and have natural explanations. A rainbow is just a peculiar sort of cloud.

This idea suggests a theory of how gods are invented. Natural phenomena, especially those that are particularly striking or important to us, are personified and given lives that go beyond what is observable.

It is clear that there is a kind of natural unity between nature philosophy and criticism of Homer’s gods. They go together and mutually reinforce one another.

### Epistemology

> The gods have not revealed all things from the beginning to mortals; but, by seeking, men find out, in time, what is better.
>
> No man knows the truth, nor will there be a man who has knowledge about the gods and what I say about everything. For even if he were to hit by chance upon the whole truth, he himself would not be aware of having done so, but each forms his own opinion.
>
> Let these things, then, be taken as like the truth.

1. Xenophanes explicitly denies the poets’ claims of inspiration.

    The gods have *not* revealed to us in this way “from the beginning” what is true. A poet’s claim of divine revelation is no guarantee of her poem’s truth.

2. How should we form our beliefs? By “**seeking**.”

    Xenophanes envisages a process of moving toward the truth. If we want the truth, we should face not the past (Homer and Hesiod) but the future. “In time”—not all at once—we will discover “what is better.” We may not succeed in finding the truth, but our opinions will be “better,” or more “like the truth.”

3. There is no certainty of truth for human beings.

    It may be that we know some truth already. Perhaps there is even someone who knows “the whole truth.” But even if he did, he would not be able to distinguish his knowledge of the truth from mere opinion. Here is a theme that later skeptics take up.

4. Not all beliefs are equally good.

    Although we may never be certain we have reached the truth, some beliefs are better or closer to the truth than others. But Xenophanes does not tell us how we are to tell which are better.

5. Xenophanes seems to be the father of **epistemology**.

    Until Xenophanes, Greek thought had basically been directed outward—to the gods, to the world of human beings, to nature. Xenophanes directs thought back on itself. His questioning questions itself:
    - How much can we know?
    - How can we know it?
    - Can we reach the truth?
    - Can we reach certainty about the truth?

    These are the central questions that define epistemology, the theory of knowledge.

6. God is the only one who can know the truth and know that he knows it.

    Xenophanes carries forward Homer’s emphasis on the gulf between humans and gods. The most important truth about humans is that they are not gods.

## *Sketch*: Pythagoras

Pythagoras combined mathematics and religion in a way strange to us and was active in setting up a pattern for an ideal community. His influence on Plato is substantial.

Pythagoras believed that the soul is a distinct and immortal entity, “entombed” for a while in the body. After death, the soul migrates into other bodies, sometimes the bodies of animals. To avoid both murder and cannibalism, the Pythagoreans were vegetarians.

Pythagoras held that all things are numbers. Mathematics was valued as a means to purify the soul, to disengage it from bodily concerns. In mathematical pursuits the soul lives a life akin to that of the gods.

It is said that Pythagoras was the first to call himself a philosopher, a lover of wisdom.
