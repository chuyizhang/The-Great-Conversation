# A WORD TO STUDENTS

## Study Philosophy

We all have *opinions*. The question is, which of these many opinions have *good reasons* to believe? We want to live our life as wisely as possible.

The word ”philosophy” means ”love of wisdom.”

We can’t help making decisions about crucial matters, and we express such decisions in the way we live. In a sense, everyone is already a philosopher and already engaged in philosophy.
> Whether you will philosophize or won’t philosophize, you must philosophize.

Philosophy is an examination of opinions, and also of our lives shaped by these opinions.
> The unexamined life is not worth living.

## This Book

Philosophy has developed historically, but it’s not just a recital of this following that. Philosophy is *interactive* and *conversational*.

To appreciate the line one thinker is pushing, it is important to see what he is arguing against, where he thinks that others have made mistakes, and how other thinkers have approached the same problems. No philosopher simply makes pronouncements in the dark.

## The Issues

There are certain central problems that especially concern philosophers:

1. **Metaphysics**, the theory of reality.
    - What is there? What kinds of things are there fundamentally?
    - Is the world through and through made of material stuff, or are there souls as well as bodies?
    - Is there a God? If so, of what sort?
    - Are there universal features to reality, or is everything just the particular thing that it is?
    - Does everything happen necessarily or are fresh starts possible?
2. **Epistemology**, the theory of knowledge.
    - How do we know what there is? Whether we can know anything at all? What is it to know something anyway?
    - How does knowing something differs from just believing it?
    - How is knowing something related to its being true? What is truth?
    - How far can our knowledge reach? Are some things simply unknowable?
3. **Ethics**, the theory of right and wrong, good and bad.
    - How to live our lives best?
    - Does the fact that something gives us pleasure make it the right thing to do?
    - Do we need to think about how our actions affect others? If so, in what way?
    - Are there really goods and bads, or does thinking so make it so?
    - Do we have duties? If so, where do they come from?
    - What is virtue and vice?
    - What is justice? Is justice important?
4. **Human nature**, know thyself.
    - What are we? Are we simply bits of matter caught up in the universal mechanism of the world, or do we have minds that escape this deterministic machine?
    - What is it to have a mind? Is mind separate from body? How is it related to the brain?
    - Do we have a free will?
    - How important to my self-identity is my relationship to others?
    - To what degree can I be responsible for the creation of myself?

### Relativism

Running through these issues is a fifth one that centers on the idea of **relativism**. The question is whether there is a way to get beyond the prejudices and assumptions peculiar to ourselves or our culture, or whether that’s all there is.

- Are there just opinions, with no one opinion ultimately any better than any other?
- Are all views relative to time and place, to culture and position?
- Is there no truth, or no truth that we can know to be true?

Most of the Western philosophical tradition can be thought of as a series of attempts to kill such skepticism and relativism, but the problem persists.

Our own age has the distinction of being the first age ever in which the basic assumptions of most people are relativistic. We will want to understand how we came to this point and what it means to be here. We will also want to ask ourselves how adequate this relativistic outlook is.

## Reading Philosophy

### About Arguments

Philosophers aim at the truth about fundamental matters, and in doing so they offer **arguments**. An argument offers reasons to believe.

Structure of an argument:

- **Conclusion**: some proposition the philosopher wants you to believe or thinks every rational person ought to believe
- **Premises**: reasons the philosopher offers to convince you of that conclusion

In reading philosophy, the main things to look for are the arguments. And the first thing to identify is the conclusion of the argument. Once you have identified the conclusion, you need to look for the premises.

### Evaluation of Arguments

We also need to try to evaluate the arguments. In evaluating an argument, there are two things to look at: the truth or acceptability of the premises and whether the premises actually do support the conclusion.

There are two kinds of arguments: **deductive** and **inductive**.

A good deductive argument is one in which the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. When this condition is satisfied, we say that the argument is **valid**. An argument may have validity even though the premises are not in fact true. When a deductive argument is both valid and has true premises, we say it is **sound**.

Inductive arguments have a looser relation between premises and conclusion. Here the premises give some support to the conclusion, but they fall short of guaranteeing the truth of the conclusion.

Typically philosophers aim to give *sound deductive* arguments.

You can get some help in evaluating arguments by seeing philosophers evaluating the arguments of other philosophers, and these evaluative arguments themselves may be either good or bad.
