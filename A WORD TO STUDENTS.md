# A WORD TO STUDENTS

## Study Philosophy!

> You don’t want simply to be at the mercy of accident in your opinions—for your views to be decided by irrelevant matters such as whom you happen to know or where you were brought up.

Philosophy can widen our views and enrich our opinion. It helps us to go beyond the limits of our own personal history and current position.

`I'm very fortunate to meet philosophy. I'm ready to enjoy the journey!`

> You want to believe for good reasons. That’s the right question, isn’t it? Which of these many opinions has the best reasons behind it? You want to live your life as wisely as possible.

We cannot think of philosophy simply as "a museum of ideas," and we cannot simply take philosophical ideas as artworks. For artworks, we need to appreciate and comment; however, for philosophical ideas, we need to judge right from wrong, prove, and give our own answers.

`I'd like to change my thinking pattern from "appreciating" to "judging and proving and answering." I realized that judging and proving are what I've already tried, but I'm not courageous enough to construct answers to philosophical questions by myself, which I may try later.`

> The meaning of the word ”philosophy” is ”love of wisdom.”

The word "love" implies that philosophy begins with some irrational impulses in favor of wisdom.

- Why love wisdom?
- What is wisdom?
- How can we tell if someone has wisdom?

`I love wisdom, and I'm proud of it. I will keep chasing.`

> Unfortunately, these philosophers don’t all agree either. So you might ask, If these really smart philosophers can’t agree on what wisdom says, why should I pay them any attention? The answer is—because it’s the best shot you’ve got.

Philosophy hasn't been "settled down." All we have are questions to be answered and answers given to those questions by different philosophers, which eventually shaped a conversation.

- Is there any philosophical question that has actually been solved?
- Is there any philosophical question that we all think we solved?

`This makes me a little anxiety but less afraid of reading books.`

> We can’t help making decisions about these crucial matters. We make them either well or badly, conscious of what we are doing or just stumbling along. We express such decisions in the way we live, whether or not we have ever given them a moment’s thought.
>> Whether you will philosophize or won’t philosophize, you must philosophize.

We don't "learn" philosophy. We "do" philosophy. Equality can be seen in the idea that we all live a philosophical life whether we realize it or not. If such an idea is accepted, then we must also accept that everyone certainly has some experience, or maybe even wisdom, gained from their philosophical life. The proof is that "to think or not to think" is a philosophical decision that everyone has already made. (Intellectual Equality?)

- Are people who think philosophically "better" than those who do not?
- People who don't think philosophically are also alive and make their own decisions. What does it mean?

`I decide to think philosophically and hope this idea will not change.`

> In a sense, you are already a philosopher, already engaged in the business philosophers have committed themselves to. So you shouldn’t have any problem in making a connection with what they write.

There is no gap between philosophers and "non-philosophers." Philosophical writings are understandable. (Intellectual Equality?)

`Be a philosopher, right now!`

> Philosophy is an examination of opinions, and also of our lives shaped by these opinions.
>> The unexamined life is not worth living.

Philosophy is ethical.

- Why?

> Thinking is a kind of craft. We can do it well or poorly, and we improve with practice.
>
> You can think of reading this book as a kind of apprenticeship in thinking.

Philosophical thinking is not an instinct but a skill that needs to be practiced and can be improved. Reading is an effective way to practice the skill of thinking.

- Are some people more talented in thinking?
- What are the other ways to improve the skill of thinking? Debating? Writing?

`I think I have the talent for thinking to some extent because people who are not talented in thinking may not even read this book. However, I'm not so sure right now because I see many people who are younger than me but can think better than me, which makes me anxious and sad. I believe that thinking is the right thing to do anyway and that I will be able to think better and better if I keep thinking and learning.`

## This Book

> Philosophy has developed historically, but it’s not just a recital of this following that. Philosophy is *interactive* and *conversational*.
>
> To appreciate the line one thinker is pushing, it is important to see what he is arguing against, where he thinks that others have made mistakes, and how other thinkers have approached the same problems. No philosopher simply makes pronouncements in the dark.

A philosopher arguing against another philosopher's idea is in fact acknowledging the value of that idea.

## The Issues

> Four main issues of philosophy:
>
> 1. **Metaphysics**, the theory of reality.
>    - Fundamental being?
>    - Existence of God?
>    - Causality?
> 2. **Epistemology**, the theory of knowledge.
>    - How do we know?
>    - What is truth?
>    - Limitation of knowledge?
> 3. **Ethics**, the theory of right and wrong, good and bad.
>    - Best way of living?
>    - Good and evil?
>    - Duties?
>    - Justice?
> 4. **Human nature**, know thyself.
>    - What are we?
>    - Human mind?
>    - Free will?
>    - Self-identity?

### Relativism

Running through these issues is a fifth one that centers on the idea of **relativism**. The question is whether there is a way to get beyond the prejudices and assumptions peculiar to ourselves or our culture, or whether that’s all there is.

- Are there just opinions, with no one opinion ultimately any better than any other?
- Are all views relative to time and place, to culture and position?
- Is there no truth, or no truth that we can know to be true?

Most of the Western philosophical tradition can be thought of as a series of attempts to kill such skepticism and relativism, but the problem persists.

Our own age has the distinction of being the first age ever in which the basic assumptions of most people are relativistic. We will want to understand how we came to this point and what it means to be here. We will also want to ask ourselves how adequate this relativistic outlook is.

## Reading Philosophy

### About Arguments

Philosophers aim at the truth about fundamental matters, and in doing so they offer **arguments**. An argument offers reasons to believe.

Structure of an argument:

- **Conclusion**: some proposition the philosopher wants you to believe or thinks every rational person ought to believe
- **Premises**: reasons the philosopher offers to convince you of that conclusion

In reading philosophy, the main things to look for are the arguments. And the first thing to identify is the conclusion of the argument. Once you have identified the conclusion, you need to look for the premises.

### Evaluation of Arguments

We also need to try to evaluate the arguments. In evaluating an argument, there are two things to look at: the truth or acceptability of the premises and whether the premises actually do support the conclusion.

There are two kinds of arguments: **deductive** and **inductive**.

A good deductive argument is one in which the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. When this condition is satisfied, we say that the argument is **valid**. An argument may have validity even though the premises are not in fact true. When a deductive argument is both valid and has true premises, we say it is **sound**.

Inductive arguments have a looser relation between premises and conclusion. Here the premises give some support to the conclusion, but they fall short of guaranteeing the truth of the conclusion.

Typically philosophers aim to give *sound deductive* arguments.

You can get some help in evaluating arguments by seeing philosophers evaluating the arguments of other philosophers, and these evaluative arguments themselves may be either good or bad.
